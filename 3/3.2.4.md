### 3.2 exercises

**1. Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?**

Nothing!


**2. How many rows are in `mpg`? How many columns?**

234 rows, 11 columns.


**3. What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.**

`drv` is a one-character variable describing the type of drivetrain(?) the car has (I don't know what the terminology is there). It's either f for front-wheel drive, r for rear-wheel drive, or 4 for 4-wheel drive.


**4. Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cyl`.**

`ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))`


**5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?**

This plot shows which classes of car have which types of drives. It's not very useful because it doesn't show the number of cars that are of each type and drive... I think? I dunno, it seems like pretty interesting data to me. For instance, you can see that subcompact cars come in all three types of drive, but that minivans only come in front-wheel drive.
