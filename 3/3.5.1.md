**1. What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?**

It appears to create a facet for each value of the variable, as if it were a discrete variable.

**2. What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean? How do they relate to this plot?**

```
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
```

The empty cells show that there are no cars with those cells' combination of cylinder number and drive type. Everywhere there is a dot on that plot, there is a cell with data.

**3. What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?**
```
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```

The first plot plots highway mileage by engine displacement, faceted by drive type (front, rear, all). The `.` causes the plot to not facet on the y axis. The second plot plots the same thing but split by number of cylinders. The `.` causes the plot to not facet on the x axis.
